## Cognito startup connecting the database
* Cognito is responsible for handling our login. 
* We must go into the java and set the right values.
* first right click a folder and go to the run as tab, then go to run confiurations, a box should pop up that says create manage and run configurations
* In the tabs above you want to change the project and main type to their appropriate values then switch over to the environments tab
* in that box closer to the right you should see an environment tab go the enviroment and enter the valules that should be provided to you by your instructor
